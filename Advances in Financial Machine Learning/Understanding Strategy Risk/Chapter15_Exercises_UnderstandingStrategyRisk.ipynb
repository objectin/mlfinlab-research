    "The chapter provides formula solutions, showing dependencies between:\n",
    " * SR (or $\\theta$) - Sharpe Ratio of the strategy;\n",
    " * n - trading frequency in trades per year;\n",
    " * p - precision rate of a trade;\n",
    " * $\\pi_{-}$ and $\\pi_{+}$ - Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels of a strategy;\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as an algorithm for calculating the probability of strategy failure for a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. Required inputs are:\n",
    " * $\\mu_{1}$, $\\mu_{2}$, $\\sigma_{1}$, $\\sigma_{1}$ - mean and variance parameters of the distributions;\n",
    " * p - robability of picking one of them;\n",
    " * t - number of observations (total trades);\n",
    " * n - trading frequency (trades in a year);\n",
    " * tSR - target Sharpe Ratio;\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeways from the chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    " * From the first set of variables above, the Sharpe Ratio is most sensitive to changes in precision rate. Next, come the stop-loss or take-profit changes (and are symmetric), lastly goes trading frequency. \n",
    " \n",
    " * PSR and Strategy Failure Algorithm can both be used to check if strategy fits the Sharpe Ratio requirements, however, the later is more accurate and takes into account only parameters that are under the control of the portfolio manager. \n",
    " \n",
    " * From Examples in Chapter 13, if Stop-Loss levels are close to 0, the precision rate is close to 0; if Take-Profit is close to 0, the precision rate is close to 1.  \n",
