# Chapter 10 Exercise Solutions

## Introduction
This folder contains the notebook that provides the worked solutions to the exercises found at the end of Chapter 10 of "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado (2018), as well as an implementation of the EF3M algorithm from "A mixture of Gaussians approach to mathematical portfolio oversight: The EF3M algorithm." _Quantitative Finance_, Vol. 14, No. 5, pp. 913-930, which is used in the exercise solutions.
