## Tick Data Notes
High quality tick data has been sourced from Tick Data LLC at the cost of approximately 1000 USD. The focus for our research will be on S&P 500 E-mini futures, for the period 10 September 1997 - 13 February 2019. The S&P 500 E-Mini futures data is the set which de Prado regularly references in his work and by using the same set we create a natural way to benchmark our implementations.

The folder contains the details of the tick data and the small nuances related to it.

## Chapter 3
An implementation of the answers pertaining to chapter three's questions in *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*. By answering these questions we also complete the objectives of our mini 6 week Capstone. This research will then be used later in the longer 6 month capstone as we look for a novel contribution to the literature. 

This folder contains the following:
* mlfinlab: A folder containing the snippets of code from the book, needed to answer the chapters questions.
* Chapter3 notebook: Answers to the questions in chapter 3.
* requirements.txt: The packages and version numbers used in the notebook.
* sample_dolalr_bars.csv: A 1 year sample of dollar bars for S&P500 Emini futures. Sampled at 1/50 of the daily avg dollars.
