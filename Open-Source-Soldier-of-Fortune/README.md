# Skill Set Challenge!
[Hudson & Thames](https://hudsonthames.org/) is looking for a contractor and perhaps a full-time position for a role centered on implementing the most cutting edge research, with respect to financial machine learning. It is a great opportunity to learn about the techniques whilst getting paid to work on open-source.

## Your Mission:
The following assignment is an opportunity for you to highlight your skill set and show us what your made of! It tests your ability to implement academic research for the broader quantitative finance community, and to do it in style!

### Breifing
Read the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00485).

In a Jupyter Notebook (python):

1. Implement the distance metric on a group of shares (use 50 shares) (Can use Yahoo finance to get shares data. Checkout the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) package.)
1. Implement Kruskal's algorithm on the distances to create the MST (Everything you need is contained in the first 2 pages of the paper.)
1. Create a function/class for the end-user to make use of.
1. Make sure to add docstrings and follow PEP8 code style checks. Have plenty of inline comments, good variable names and don't over complicate things unnecessarily. It should be easy for the user to make use of.
1. Showcase your new function in a Jupyter Notebook and show us some visualizations of the hierarchical structure and the MST.
1. Add an introduction, body, and conclusion showcasing your new implementation. (Use the correct style headers)
1. Make a Pull Request to this repo so that we can evaluate your work.
1. Bonus points if you add unit tests (in a separate .py file).

### Notes
* Your code for the implementation should be contained in a .py file that you import into your notebook. Please don't have large chunks of code in your notebook.
* Your function must take in a pandas DataFrame, not a file directory.
* The following notebook is a good [example](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/blob/master/Chapter16/Chapter16.ipynb).

## Institutional - Need to Know
* **Company Name**: Hudson and Thames Quantitative Research
* **Company Brief**: Our core focus is on the implementation of academic research within buy-side asset management. We are first and foremost a research group which productionalises tools in the form of libraries.
* **Company Website**: [https://hudsonthames.org/](https://hudsonthames.org/)
* **Job Title**: Quantitative Researcher & Developer
* **Location**: Virtual Team (We are all in different time zones across the world.)
* **Education**: Modules in data structures and algorithms, some math stats, familiarity with machine learning. We care a lot more about what you can do rather than your exact qualifications.
* **Work experience**: Junior to mid-level role
* **Remuneration**: Negotiable -> dependant on work experience.

## Contact us
We have recently opened access to our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/mlfinlab/shared_invite/enQtOTUzNjAyNDI1NTc1LTU0NTczNWRlM2U5ZDZiZTUxNTgzNzBlNDU3YmY5MThkODdiMTgwNzI5NDQ2NWI0YTYyMmI3MjBkMzY2YjVkNzc) to help form a community and encourage contributions.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
